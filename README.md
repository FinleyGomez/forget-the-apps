# Forget-The-Apps

## About Forget-The-Apps
Forget-The-Apps is an AdBlock filter that blocks all the annoying App Store and Google Play buttons from websites as well as any other mobile webstore buttons/links

## How We Create Our Filters
We created our filter using uBlock Origin (Version 1.31.2) on the Vivaldi browser (Version 3.1.1929.45 (64-bit)) and we tested it on Firefox (Version 84.0.1 (64-bit)).

## Requirements To Install Forget-The-Apps On Your Browser
In order to get Forget-The-Apps to work, you are going to need to install an Ad-Blocker plugin for your browser. We **highly** recommend using [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), but this also works with other ad-blockers such as:

 - [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/)
 - [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)
 - [Adaway](https://adaway.org/)
 - [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/)
 - [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/)
 - [Blockada](https://blokada.org/)

Most, if not all of these work with all the most popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi, Brave etc.

***NOTE***: We **strongly** recommend that you **do NOT** use Nano Adblocker and/or Nano Defender, as [they were caught collecting user data with malicious code back in October 2020](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-removes-two-chrome-ad-blockers-caught-collecting-user-data/)!
